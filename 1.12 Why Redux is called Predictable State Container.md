# Why redux is called a predictable state container?

1. Because of it's predictable data flow. Action -> State -> View. This sequence will be maintained always so we can predict what is going to happen after what.

2. Why Redux is predictable? - because using redux you will know what every action in application will do and how the state will change

## ðŸ“‹ Key Principles of Redux

1. State is an immutable object - We will not directly mutate the state.
2. We can't mutate the application state, we will always return a new modified state.
3. All state changes are initiated through actions. We can't change state through other functions.
4. Reducers take current state and action as arguments and return a new state.

```js
(state, action) => newState;
```

5. Every single state change in reducers has to be taken care of by developers explicitly. Control is in our hands.

6. Reducers are supposed to be pure functions and that is where the predictability comes from. Because we know that it will not change something outside and will always give output based on the input we provide. Nothing else.

## Unidirectional Data Flow

```
state -> action -> reducer -> state -> action -> reducer
```

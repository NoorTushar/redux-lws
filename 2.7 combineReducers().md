# Redux combineReducers()

-  modularize Redux reducers for better maintainability

## Why do we need it?

-  When we will have multiple features on our application, alongside we will have multiple reducers. But store can have only one reducer. So we need to combine all our reducers into one single reducer and then pass onto the store.

-  For that in the root folder of redux, we will create `rootReducer.js`

src -> redux -> rootReducer.js

```js
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import dynamicCounterReducer from "./dynamicCounter/dynamicCounterReducer";
import counterReducer from "./counter/counterReducer";

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
   counter: counterReducer, // property name is upto us
   dynamicCounter: dynamicCounterReducer, // property name is upto us
});

export default rootReducer;
```

therefore, our store.js

```js
import { createStore } from "redux";
import rootReducer from "./rootReducer";

const store = createStore(rootReducer); // our store will have only one reducer

export default store;
```

Now we can access different states from these different reducers like this. For example we have `dynamicCounter` and we have `counter` states. If we want to get the value of `dynamicCounter` state then we will simply write the code like this:

```js
const count = useSelector((state) => state.dynamicCounter.value);
```

and to get the value from `count` state

```js
const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
```

## Summary

-  If we want to implement different features, they will have different reducer function and different state.
-  If we want to combine the reducers we will use combineReducers() method of Redux
-  We will pass this `rootReducer` to the store.
-  If we want to select/ get values based on specific feature, we will use `state.theNameWeGave.value`
